# ShiftWizard Production Deployment Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide will help you deploy ShiftWizard with all its intelligent scheduling features to production:

‚úÖ **Real-time Metrics Dashboard** with WebSocket connections  
‚úÖ **Python Scheduling Algorithm** with OR-Tools optimization  
‚úÖ **AI-Powered Suggestions** using OpenAI GPT-4  
‚úÖ **Secure Production Environment** with automated monitoring  

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Get a Server

Choose any cloud provider:
- **Vultr** (recommended): $6/month VPS
- **DigitalOcean**: $6/month droplet
- **AWS**: t3.micro or t3.small
- **Linode**: $5/month nanode

**Requirements:**
- Ubuntu 20.04+ LTS
- Minimum 1GB RAM
- 25GB+ storage
- Root access

### Step 2: Run Server Setup

SSH into your server and run:

```bash
# Create deploy user (recommended)
adduser deploy
usermod -aG sudo deploy
su deploy

# Download and run setup script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/shiftwizard/main/scripts/setup-server.sh
chmod +x setup-server.sh
./setup-server.sh
```

This script will:
- Install Node.js 18, Python 3, Docker, Nginx
- Configure firewall and security
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Create directory structure
- Generate environment templates

### Step 3: Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy and edit environment file
sudo cp /etc/shiftwizard/.env.production.template /etc/shiftwizard/.env.production
sudo nano /etc/shiftwizard/.env.production
```

**Required Settings:**
```bash
# Your domain
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# OpenAI API Key (REQUIRED for AI suggestions)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here

# Email settings (for notifications)
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Step 4: Setup SSL Certificate

```bash
# Install Let's Encrypt certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

### Step 5: Configure GitHub Actions

In your GitHub repository, add these secrets:

**Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and Variables ‚Üí Actions:**

- `PRODUCTION_HOST`: Your server IP address
- `PRODUCTION_USER`: `deploy` (or your username)
- `PRODUCTION_SSH_KEY`: Your private SSH key content
- `PRODUCTION_URL`: `https://yourdomain.com`

### Step 6: Deploy

Push to your main branch, and GitHub Actions will automatically deploy!

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy ShiftWizard with AI scheduling"
git push origin main
```

## üîß Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
# Clone repository
cd /var/www/shiftwizard
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/shiftwizard.git .

# Install dependencies
npm ci
cd backend && npm ci && cd ..

# Build frontend
npm run build

# Copy environment
sudo cp /etc/shiftwizard/.env.production backend/.env

# Initialize database
cd backend && node scripts/init-db.js && node scripts/seed-db.js

# Start with PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save
```

---

## üè• Health Checks

After deployment, verify everything works:

```bash
# Check application health
curl https://yourdomain.com/health

# Check WebSocket connection
curl -H "Upgrade: websocket" https://yourdomain.com/socket.io/

# Test AI suggestions (requires auth)
# Login to your app and check the scheduling features
```

## üìà Monitoring & Maintenance

### Log Files
```bash
# Application logs
tail -f /var/log/shiftwizard/app.log

# Nginx logs
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

# Monitoring logs
tail -f /var/log/shiftwizard/monitor.log
```

### PM2 Commands
```bash
pm2 status          # Check application status
pm2 logs shiftwizard # View application logs
pm2 restart shiftwizard # Restart application
pm2 reload shiftwizard  # Zero-downtime restart
```

### Health Monitoring
The system automatically:

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**üî¥ "AI suggestions not working"**
- Check OpenAI API key in environment file
- Verify API key has credits and correct permissions
- Check logs: `tail -f /var/log/shiftwizard/app.log`

**üî¥ "WebSocket connection failed"**
- Verify Nginx configuration includes WebSocket proxy
- Check firewall allows connections on port 443
- Test with: `curl -H "Upgrade: websocket" https://yourdomain.com/socket.io/`

**üî¥ "Python scheduling algorithm errors"**
- Check Python packages: `pip3 list | grep ortools`
- Verify Python path in application logs
- Test manually: `cd backend && python3 workforce_scheduling_engine.py`

**üî¥ "Database connection issues"**
- Check file permissions on database file
- Verify database initialization: `ls -la backend/data/`
- Re-run init: `cd backend && node scripts/init-db.js`

### Performance Optimization

For high-traffic deployments:

1. **Enable PostgreSQL** (instead of SQLite)
2. **Add Redis** for session storage
3. **Use Docker Compose** for scaling
4. **Enable CDN** for static assets
5. **Add load balancer** for multiple instances
