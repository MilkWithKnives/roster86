# Frontend Validation Enhancement Test

## Summary of Changes

### 1. EmployeeForm Validation
- Added comprehensive validation for all form fields:
  - Full name: minimum 2 characters
  - Employee ID: required field
  - Email: proper email format validation
  - Phone: numeric format validation
  - Hourly rate: positive number validation
  - Max hours per week: 1-168 range validation
- Enhanced error handling with backend validation error display
- Added visual error messages for each field

### 2. TemplateForm Validation
- Added comprehensive validation:
  - Template name: minimum 2 characters
  - Time validation: end time must be after start time
  - Staff validation: min_staff >= 1, max_staff >= min_staff
  - Priority: 1-10 range validation
- Enhanced error handling with backend validation error display
- Added visual error messages for each field

### 3. Authentication Forms
- **Login Form**: 
  - Email format validation
  - Password minimum length (6 characters)
  - Better backend error message display
  
- **Register Form**:
  - Full name minimum length (2 characters)
  - Email format validation
  - Strong password requirements (8 chars, upper, lower, number)
  - Backend validation error mapping

### 4. Error Display System
- Added consistent error display patterns across all forms
- Red error messages below each field
- General error display at top of forms for non-field-specific errors
- Backend validation error mapping for detailed feedback

## Test Cases to Verify

### Employee Form
1. Try creating employee with empty name → Should show "Full name must be at least 2 characters"
2. Try invalid email format → Should show "Please enter a valid email address"
3. Try invalid phone with letters → Should show "Please enter a valid phone number"
4. Try negative hourly rate → Should show "Hourly rate must be a positive number"
5. Try max hours > 168 → Should show "Max hours per week must be between 1 and 168"

### Template Form
1. Try empty template name → Should show "Template name must be at least 2 characters"
2. Set end time before start time → Should show "End time must be after start time"
3. Set min_staff to 0 → Should show "Minimum staff must be at least 1"
4. Set max_staff < min_staff → Should show "Maximum staff must be greater than or equal to minimum staff"
5. Set priority outside 1-10 range → Should show "Priority must be between 1 and 10"

### Login Form
1. Try invalid email format → Should show "Please enter a valid email address"
2. Try password < 6 chars → Should show "Password must be at least 6 characters long"

### Register Form
1. Try name with 1 character → Should show "Full name must be at least 2 characters long"
2. Try password < 8 chars → Should show "Password must be at least 8 characters long"
3. Try password without complexity → Should show complexity requirements message

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Better User Experience**: Users get immediate feedback on what needs to be fixed
2. **Reduced API Errors**: Frontend validation prevents many unnecessary API calls
3. **Consistent Error Handling**: All forms now handle errors in a uniform way
4. **Data Quality**: Better validation ensures cleaner data entry
5. **Security**: Stronger password requirements and input validation

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Test each form with invalid inputs
3. Verify error messages appear correctly
4. Test with backend running to ensure backend error mapping works
5. Verify successful form submissions still work with valid data
