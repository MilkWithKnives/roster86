## üéØ Key Features Explained

### Budget Management
**Problem**: Restaurant GMs need to control labor costs
**Solution**: Set weekly/daily caps + target costs

**Example**:
- Weekly Cap: $8,000 (HARD - won't exceed)
- Daily Cap: $1,200 (prevents overstaffing)
- Target: $7,500 (soft goal to aim for)
- **Result**: Schedule costs $7,650 (95.6% utilization) ‚úì

### Fairness & Balance
**Problem**: Employees complain about unequal treatment
**Solution**: Automated fairness constraints

**Example**:
- Max 6 consecutive days (prevents burnout)
- Min 12 hours rest (prevents clopening)
- Even shift distribution (no favoritism)
- **Result**: All employees happy, low turnover ‚úì

### Smart Scheduling
**Problem**: Manual scheduling takes hours and misses optimal solutions
**Solution**: OptaPlanner algorithms find near-optimal schedules in seconds

**Example**:
- Manual: 2-4 hours, 85% coverage, $8,200 cost
- Automated: 30 seconds, 100% coverage, $7,650 cost
- **Savings**: $550/week = $28,600/year ‚úì

## üí° Pro Tips (From a GM Perspective)

### 1. **Set Realistic Budgets**
- Base weekly budget on 28-32% of projected sales
- Adjust for seasonality (summer vs winter)
- Factor in holidays and special events

### 2. **Use Daily Caps Strategically**
- Monday-Thursday: Lower cap (slow days)
- Friday-Saturday: Higher cap (busy days)
- Sunday: Medium cap (brunch crowd)

### 3. **Balance Fairness vs Cost**
- Higher fairness = slightly higher costs
- But = lower turnover = long-term savings
- Sweet spot: 70-80% fairness weight

### 4. **Leverage Target Costs**
- Set target 5-10% below weekly cap
- Gives scheduling flexibility
- Avoids hitting cap every week

### 5. **Review Metrics Weekly**
- Track actual vs estimated costs
- Monitor fairness scores
- Adjust constraints based on results

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ortools'"
**Solution**:
```bash
cd backend
./install_and_test.sh
```
Or manually:
```bash
pip3 install --user ortools
```

### Issue: "Budget exceeded, can't generate schedule"
**Causes**:
1. Budget too tight for requirements
2. Too many shifts defined
3. Hourly rates too high

**Solutions**:
1. Increase weekly budget cap
2. Reduce required staff per shift
3. Lower some hourly rates (if test data)
4. Enable overtime if needed

### Issue: "Coverage gaps - shifts not filled"
**Causes**:
1. Not enough eligible workers
2. Skill gaps (no one has required skills)
3. Availability conflicts
4. Fairness constraints too strict

**Solutions**:
1. Add more workers
2. Cross-train employees (more skills)
3. Expand availability windows
4. Relax max consecutive days (6‚Üí7)

### Issue: "Frontend not updating budget values"
**Check**:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Store is saving values (`useSchedulingStore`)
3. Network tab shows API calls
4. Clear browser cache and reload
