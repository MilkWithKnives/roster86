## 🚀 How to Use (For You as a Restaurant GM)

### Step 1: Set Your Budget (Budget Tab)

1. Go to **Budget Tab**
2. Set **Weekly Budget Cap**: e.g., $8,000 (HARD limit - won't exceed this)
3. Enable **Daily Budget** if needed: e.g., $1,200/day to control daily costs
4. Set **Target Cost** (optional): e.g., $7,500 (soft goal to aim for)
5. Watch the **real-time cost estimate** update as you configure shifts

**When to use what:**
- **Weekly Cap**: Your absolute maximum (from corporate, ownership, or P&L)
- **Daily Cap**: Prevent overstaffing on slow days (Mon-Thu) vs busy days (Fri-Sat)
- **Target**: What you'd like to hit (gives scheduler flexibility)

### Step 2: Configure Fairness Rules (Rules Tab)

1. Go to **Rules Tab** → **Soft Rules**
2. Adjust **Max Consecutive Days**: Default 6 days (prevents burnout)
3. Set **Minimum Rest Hours**: Default 12h (prevents clopening)
4. Adjust **Hours Balance**: Higher % = more even distribution across staff
5. Set **Weekend Balance**: Higher % = fair rotation of weekend shifts

**Why this matters:**
- **Clopening prevention**: Staff closing at 11 PM can't open at 6 AM next day
- **Burnout prevention**: Nobody works 10 days straight
- **Fairness**: Everyone gets similar hours and weekend rotations

### Step 3: Generate Schedule (Review Tab)

1. Configure all other tabs (Employees, Business Hours, Coverage)
2. Go to **Review & Simulate** tab
3. Click **"Generate Schedule"**
4. Watch progress:
   - "Phase 1: Construction heuristic (First Fit Decreasing)"
   - "Phase 2: Local search refinement (Tabu Search)"
5. Review results:
   - **Total Cost**: $7,650 (within budget ✓)
   - **Budget Utilization**: 95.6%
   - **Coverage**: 100% (all shifts filled)
   - **Fairness Score**: 87/100

### Step 4: Review & Adjust

If schedule doesn't work:
- **"Budget exceeded"** → Increase weekly cap OR reduce shift requirements
- **"Coverage gaps"** → Add more staff OR reduce required staff per shift
- **"Unfair distribution"** → Adjust fairness sliders OR add more availability

## 🎯 Real-World Examples (Restaurant GM Scenarios)

### Scenario 1: Tight Budget Week

**Situation**: Projected sales down 15%, need to cut labor costs

**Actions:**
1. Budget Tab: Lower weekly cap from $8,000 to $7,000
2. Coverage Tab: Reduce min staff requirements slightly (5→4 servers on slow nights)
3. Generate schedule
4. Result: Scheduler optimizes to $6,850, all shifts covered with fewer staff

**Benefit**: Stay profitable on slow week while maintaining coverage

---

### Scenario 2: Preventing Employee Burnout

**Situation**: Server complained about working 8 days straight last month

**Actions:**
1. Rules Tab: Set "Max Consecutive Days" to 5 (was 6)
2. Rules Tab: Set "Min Rest Hours" to 14h (was 12h)
3. Generate schedule
4. Result: No employee works more than 5 consecutive days, adequate rest

**Benefit**: Happier employees, better service quality, lower turnover

---

### Scenario 3: Weekend Fairness

**Situation**: Same people always work Friday-Sunday, others never do

**Actions:**
1. Rules Tab: Increase "Weekend Balance" to 90% (was 50%)
2. Generate schedule
3. Result: Weekend shifts distributed evenly across all eligible staff

**Benefit**: Fair treatment, reduces resentment, improves morale

---

### Scenario 4: Budget + Busy Weekend

**Situation**: Big event weekend, need more staff but have budget limit

**Actions:**
1. Budget Tab: Enable "Daily Budget", set higher for Fri-Sun ($1,800), lower for Mon-Thu ($800)
2. Coverage Tab: Increase requirements for Fri-Sun
3. Generate schedule
4. Result: More staff on busy days, fewer on slow days, stays under weekly budget

**Benefit**: Right staffing levels, maximize revenue, control costs
